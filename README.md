fx is a coding agent harness and CLI written in Zig, optimized for research and embeddability as part of larger systems.

It focuses on minimalism and performance across the board, from system prompt design to its tools, feature set, and 7.8 MiB binary.

For end users, its CLI output style and form factor aim to be closer to a Unix shell than a heavy "IDE in the terminal" TUI.

It's open source (Apache-2.0), model-agnostic, and suitable for both local and cloud inference.

## About this fork (`byok`)

This is the `byok` branch of [`acking-you/fx`](https://github.com/acking-you/fx), a fork of upstream [`vercel-labs/fx`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/fx). Upstream stays the source of truth for the shared codebase and is merged in regularly; this branch exists for the work upstream would not take, aimed at three goals.

**1. Remove every hard binding to Vercel.** Upstream is model-agnostic in principle but is wired to one hosted path in practice: `fx login` signs in with Vercel, credentials resolve through Vercel OIDC and AI Gateway keys, and the model catalog and request endpoint assume that gateway. This fork treats all of it as one provider among many. Vercel remains fully supported, never required — nothing in a default run should assume that account, that gateway, or that key.

**2. Support any BYOK provider.** Bring the key you already pay for and point fx at whatever speaks the protocol: an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, a corporate proxy, a self-hosted or local server, or another commercial provider. That means configurable base URLs, credentials from the environment or a local store instead of one vendor's login, and model catalogs that are not the upstream default.

**3. Improve the agent harness.** Better default agent behavior even where upstream keeps it optional or absent. Streamed model reasoning, for example, is always shown and is replayed to the provider as reasoning context for the rest of the turn, so the model keeps its own reasoning across tool steps rather than losing it.

### Status

Goals 1 and 2 are in progress, not finished. Today `fx login` still signs in with Vercel, credentials still resolve through Vercel OIDC or an AI Gateway key, and `FX_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` is honored only for a loopback address because the base URL carries the bearer token — a remote override is ignored rather than used. Goal 3 has landed in part: the reasoning behavior described above works now. Treat the first two goals as the direction of this branch, and check the code before assuming a given endpoint or credential source is already supported.

Fork changes stay deliberately small and shaped like upstream's own code: divergence costs a merge conflict every time, and a change that fits upstream's structure can still be sent back as a pull request. Bug fixes and features upstream would plausibly accept are contributed to `vercel-labs/fx` rather than kept here. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for branch roles and the merge routine.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fx.sh/setup.sh | bash
```

## Run fx

To get started, sign in with Vercel:

```bash
fx login
```

Or add an AI Gateway API key:

```bash
fx setup
```

Run fx from a project:

```bash
cd your_project
fx
```

The current directory becomes the primary workspace. Enter a prompt, or run `/help` to browse interactive commands.

List saved sessions with `fx sessions`. Resume the latest session for the current workspace, or select an exact session ID, through the same command group:

```bash
fx session resume last
fx session resume --id <id>
```

Each interactive session names its terminal tab. The title prefers the session name, falls back to the workspace name, and keeps the active model as secondary context. Renaming or resuming a session updates the tab, and exiting clears the fx-owned title. Noninteractive commands do not emit terminal-title controls.

Run `/feedback` to open the feedback form at `fx.sh/feedback`. It does not create a diagnostic or change the clipboard.

Run `/trace` to create a private Markdown diagnostic with logs, session context, runtime state, permissions, and recent activity. On macOS, fx copies the `.md` file to the clipboard; on other platforms, it saves the file and prints its path. Review and redact the trace before sharing it.

Use `fx ask` for a single request:

```bash
fx ask "explain the changes in this repository"
fx ask --show-thinking "explain the changes in this repository"
```

Streamed model reasoning always appears in the interactive transcript, trimmed to its most recent lines so the answer stays in view. The full reasoning body is replayed to the provider as reasoning context for the remaining steps of the same turn, never truncated. ACP sessions always emit `agent_thought_chunk` updates. `fx ask` writes reasoning to stderr with `--show-thinking`, and `fx ask --json` includes a separate `thinking` field when reasoning is present; it is never merged into `output`.

fx starts in `auto` permission mode. Routine understood development actions run directly; unresolved sensitive actions receive one bounded automatic review. A blocked action may return an exact approval request that the agent can send to fx's real permission screen. Ordinary question text never grants permission. See [Permissions](https://fx.sh/docs/configure-fx/permissions) for other modes and persistent rules.

JSON and quiet requests stay noninteractive by default. Add `--prompt-permissions` to allow the existing Y/N approval prompt when stdin is a TTY. Prompt text is written to stderr, so JSON stdout stays parseable and quiet stdout stays empty. Piped or redirected stdin remains noninteractive and fails instead of waiting for approval.

Inside a saved session, `/permissions remember <allow|deny> <tool-name> <arguments-json>` stores an exact confirmed rule without running the action. `/permissions` lists stable rule IDs, and `/permissions revoke <rule-id>` removes a stored rule even when its original workspace or file state has changed.

## Embed fx

fx builds as a native binary or WebAssembly. Applications embedding fx can provide network transport, session storage, configuration, permission handling, and terminal I/O.

| Surface | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `fx acp` | Connect the native agent to editors and other Agent Client Protocol clients. |
| `createFxAgent()` | Embed the agent core in a JavaScript host with `fx-core.wasm`. |
| `createFxTerminal()` | Embed the interactive terminal with `fx-term.wasm`. |

The WebAssembly SDK is experimental. See the [WebAssembly SDK](sdk/README.md) and [ACP documentation](https://fx.sh/docs/using-fx/acp).

## Extend fx

Add reusable instructions with [skills](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/skills), connect external tools through [MCP](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/mcp), or delegate independent work to [subagents](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/subagents). Project instruction files may link within their scope, and read-only workspace or compatibility skill directories may link within their owning workspace or home; managed skills, `SKILL.md` files, resources, and escaping links remain no-follow. `fx status` and `fx doctor` report an invalid trusted MCP profile without starting its servers.

## Documentation

Read the [fx documentation](https://fx.sh/docs).

## Build from source

Building fx requires [Zig 0.16.0+](https://ziglang.org/download/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vercel-labs/fx.git
cd fx
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
./zig-out/bin/fx
```

Run the test suite with `zig build test`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development and contribution guidelines.
